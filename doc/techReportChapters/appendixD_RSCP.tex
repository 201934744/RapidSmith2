\section{RSCP and TCP Format} \label{sec:rscpTcp}

As shown in \autoref{fig:UsageModels}, RapidSmith2 parses RapidSmith Checkpoints
(RSCP) generated from \texttt{Tincr}, and creates Tincr Checkpoints (TCP) that
can be loaded back into Vivado. This documentation does not have a detailed
discussion of the contents and format of RSCPs and TCPs. For advanced users, a
very detailed description of these checkpoint formats is given in Thomas
Townsend's masters thesis located for download at {\color{blue}
http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/6492/}.
